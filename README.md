# Linux Fundamentals - Part 1: Basics

## Introduction
This document covers fundamental concepts of Linux, including the kernel, file system, process management, shell scripting, and user management. It also provides practical terminal commands for hands-on learning.

## Kernel
The kernel is the core component of an operating system, responsible for managing hardware and software resources. It facilitates interactions between components, allocates system resources, and manages memory and peripheral devices.

### Types of Kernels
1. **Monolithic Kernel** - All OS services run in the kernel space.

### Kernel Commands
- `uname -r` - Display kernel version.
- `dmesg | less` - View system boot messages.
- `uptime` - Show system uptime.
- `cat /proc/version` - View kernel version and compilation details.

## RAM (Random Access Memory)
RAM stores program instructions and data temporarily. The kernel manages memory allocation to processes.

### Memory Management Commands
- `free -h` - Display memory usage.
- `vmstat` - Show system performance metrics.
- `top` or `htop` - Monitor real-time resource usage.
- `cat /proc/meminfo` - Show detailed memory statistics.

## Shell
The shell is an interface for users to interact with the Linux system through commands.

### Types of Shells
- **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)** - Default in most Linux distributions ($ prompt).
- **Bourne Shell (sh)** - The original Unix shell.
- **C Shell (csh)** - Syntax similar to C programming, preferred by some administrators (% prompt).

### Shell Commands
- `echo $SHELL` - Check the current shell.
- `chsh -s /bin/bash` - Change default shell to Bash.
- `history` - Show command history.
- `alias ll='ls -la'` - Create a shortcut for commands.

## Linux File System Hierarchy (FHS)
The File System Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines directory structures in Linux.

### Key Directories
- **/bin** - Essential user commands.
- **/boot** - Boot-related files.
- **/dev** - Device files.
- **/etc** - Configuration files.
- **/home** - User directories.
- **/lib** - Shared system libraries.
- **/media** - Mount point for removable media.
- **/mnt** - Temporary mount point.
- **/opt** - Optional software packages.
- **/root** - Home directory for root.
- **/sbin** - System administration utilities.
- **/srv** - Data served by the system.
- **/tmp** - Temporary files.
- **/usr** - User applications and libraries.
- **/var** - Logs, cache, and spool files.

### File System Commands
- `ls -l` - List files with details.
- `pwd` - Show current directory.
- `cd /path` - Change directory.
- `df -h` - Show disk space usage.
- `du -sh directory/` - Show directory size.

## Linux File Types
- **Regular files (-)** - Text, scripts, binary files.
- **Directory (d)** - Contains files and subdirectories.
- **Character device files (c)** - Interfaces for hardware.
- **Block device files (b)** - Storage devices like hard drives.
- **Socket files (s)** - Local inter-process communication.
- **Named pipes (p)** - FIFO communication between processes.
- **Symbolic links (l)** - Shortcuts to files or directories.

## Control Operators
- **Semicolon (;)** - Runs multiple commands sequentially.
- **Ampersand (&)** - Executes a command in the background.
- **Double ampersand (&&)** - Runs the second command only if the first succeeds.
- **Hash (#)** - Commenting in scripts.

### Practical Examples
- `mkdir test; cd test` - Create and navigate to a directory.
- `echo "hello" > file.txt &` - Write to a file in the background.
- `ls && echo "Listed successfully"` - List files only if the command succeeds.

## I/O Redirection
- Redirects command input/output to/from files.
- Example: `echo "text" >> file.txt` (appends text to a file).

### Redirection Commands
- `cat file.txt > newfile.txt` - Copy file contents.
- `sort < file.txt > sorted.txt` - Sort file and save output.
- `grep error logfile.txt >> errors.txt` - Append errors to a file.

## Filters and Pipes
- **Filters** - Process data from another command (e.g., `grep`).
- **Pipes (|)** - Pass output of one command to another.
# **üîç `grep` Command in Linux - Explained with Examples**  

The `grep` command is used to **search for a specific pattern** (word, phrase, or regex) in a file or multiple files. It scans the text and prints lines that match the pattern.  

üìå **Syntax:**  
```bash
grep [OPTIONS] PATTERN FILE
```
- **`PATTERN`** ‚Üí The text or regex to search for.  
- **`FILE`** ‚Üí The file(s) in which to search.  
- **`OPTIONS`** ‚Üí Modify `grep` behavior (like case-insensitive search, whole word match, etc.).

# Linux Fundamentals - Part 3:  All Stages of Linux Booting Process



## 1. BIOS Initialization

- **What It Is:**  
  The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is firmware embedded on the motherboard. It is the first software to run when you power on the computer.

- **Key Tasks:**  
  - **POST (Power-On Self Test):** Checks hardware components (CPU, memory, peripherals) for basic functionality.  
  - **Boot Device Selection:** Based on a configurable boot order, BIOS looks for a bootable device (e.g., hard drive, USB, CD-ROM).  
  - **Boot Sector Read:** Once a boot device is selected, BIOS reads the boot sector‚Äîthe first physical sector on that storage device‚Äîwhich contains minimal code to start the boot process.

---

## 2. The Master Boot Record (MBR)

- **What It Is:**  
  For hard disks and many other storage devices, the boot sector is the MBR. It is a 512-byte area located at the very beginning of the disk.

- **Structure of MBR:**  
  - **First 446 Bytes:** Contains executable boot code.  
  - **Next 64 Bytes:** Holds the partition table for up to 4 primary partitions (16 bytes per partition).  
  - **Last 2 Bytes:** Contains a boot signature (magic number) to validate the MBR.

- **Purpose:**  
  The boot code in the MBR identifies the active partition and transfers control to a bootloader located in that partition.

Sure! Let's simplify the **Master Boot Record (MBR) process** step by step.

### **What is MBR?**
- The **Master Boot Record (MBR)** is a tiny piece of code located in the **first sector** of the hard disk.
- It is **only 512 bytes in size** and is responsible for **loading the bootloader** into memory.

---

### **How MBR Works in Booting**
1. **BIOS hands over control to MBR**  
   - When you turn on your computer, **BIOS** initializes hardware and searches for a **bootable device** (HDD, USB, CD, etc.).
   - Once it finds a bootable device, it **loads the first 512 bytes** of that device into memory.
   
2. **MBR structure**  
   The MBR consists of:
   - **First 446 bytes:** Contains the **bootloader code** (this helps load the OS).
   - **Next 64 bytes:** Stores the **partition table** (info about 4 primary partitions).
   - **Last 2 bytes:** Contains the **MBR signature (magic number)** to confirm it's a valid MBR.

3. **Loading the Bootloader**  
   - The **first 446 bytes** of MBR contains code that identifies the **active partition** where the OS is stored.
   - It then loads the bootloader (e.g., **GRUB**) from that partition into memory.
   - The bootloader then takes over and continues the boot process.

---

### **Key Points to Remember**
- MBR is **only 512 bytes** in size.
- It contains the **bootloader** and **partition table**.
- MBR loads the **bootloader**, which then loads the operating system.
- If MBR is damaged, the system **won‚Äôt boot** (can be fixed using recovery tools).


The reason why **only 512 bytes** (the Master Boot Record or MBR) is loaded into memory initially is due to **historical hardware limitations and efficiency considerations**. 

Let‚Äôs break it down:

---

### **1. Hardware Limitations (BIOS Design)**
- The **BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)** was originally designed in the late 1970s and early 1980s, when computers had very limited memory and processing power.
- The BIOS is a **very simple program**, and it can only read **a fixed small amount of data** from the storage device at first.
- Early disk controllers and BIOS implementations were designed to read **one sector (512 bytes) at a time**.
- Loading a large chunk of data wasn‚Äôt practical back then.

---

### **2. Bootstrapping Process (Small Code to Load Bigger Code)**
- The MBR acts as a **bootstrap loader** ‚Äì meaning it contains just **enough code** to find and load a more complex bootloader (like GRUB or Windows Boot Manager).
- A full operating system is **too large** to fit into the initial memory, so the MBR just loads the next stage of the boot process.

---

### **3. Standardization & Compatibility**
- The **512-byte sector size** became an industry standard, so BIOS and disk manufacturers followed this convention.
- Even modern systems support this method for **backward compatibility**.

---

### **4. Efficient Use of Memory**
- Early computers had **very limited RAM** (often in kilobytes), so loading **only 512 bytes** kept memory usage low.
- The BIOS only needs a small set of instructions to find the **real** bootloader, which can then load the full OS.

---

### **Analogy: A Small Key Unlocks a Bigger Door**
Think of the **MBR** as a tiny key that unlocks a larger, more complex system:  
üîë **MBR (512 bytes) ‚Üí Loads Bootloader ‚Üí Loads Operating System**  

---

## 3. The GRUB Bootloader

GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) is the most common bootloader used in Linux systems. It is responsible for loading the Linux kernel into memory.
Absolutely! Let‚Äôs go step by step and make the **GRUB (Grand Unified Bootloader)** process easy to understand.  

---

## **What is GRUB?**
GRUB is a **bootloader** that helps your computer load and start an operating system (like Linux).  
Think of GRUB as a **menu system** that lets you choose which OS to boot.

---

## **GRUB Boot Process (Simplified)**
The GRUB boot process happens in **3 main stages**:  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Stage 1: BIOS & MBR Execution (First 512 bytes)**  
- When you turn on your computer, the **BIOS** starts and looks for a bootable disk.  
- It reads the **MBR (first 512 bytes of the disk)**, which contains a small **GRUB Stage 1** code.  
- This code is **very tiny** and its job is to find and load the **next stage** of GRUB.  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Stage 2: Loading GRUB Core (More Features)**  
- Since MBR is too small to hold the entire GRUB, **Stage 1 loads the GRUB core** from disk.  
- The **GRUB core** is stored in the **/boot/grub/** directory and contains:  
  - Filesystem drivers (so GRUB can read different disk formats).  
  - The ability to load modules and display a menu.  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Stage 3: GRUB Menu & OS Selection**  
- Now, GRUB **displays a menu** where you can select the OS to boot.  
- If you do nothing, it will automatically boot the **default OS** after a few seconds.  
- When you choose an OS, GRUB loads its **kernel (main system file)** into memory.  

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Final Step: OS Kernel Takes Over**  
- After selecting the OS, GRUB loads the **Linux Kernel** into memory.  
- The **kernel** then initializes the system and starts the operating system.  
- Once the OS is loaded, GRUB‚Äôs job is done! üéâ  

---

## **üîπ Summary in Simple Terms**
1Ô∏è‚É£ BIOS starts and loads the **MBR (512 bytes) ‚Üí GRUB Stage 1**  
2Ô∏è‚É£ GRUB Stage 1 loads the **GRUB Core (More advanced GRUB features)**  
3Ô∏è‚É£ GRUB displays a **menu** where you choose the OS  
4Ô∏è‚É£ GRUB loads the **Linux Kernel** and starts the OS  



### GRUB‚Äôs Multi-Stage Process

#### GRUB Version 1 (Legacy)
- **Stage 1:**  
  - Resides in the MBR.
  - Very small; its main job is to locate and load Stage 1.5.
- **Stage 1.5:**  
  - Typically installed in the 30 KB gap between the MBR and the first partition.
  - Contains filesystem drivers so it can read the filesystem (e.g., /boot).
- **Stage 2:**  
  - Stored in the /boot/grub directory.
  - Loads the configuration file (e.g., `grub.conf`) and additional modules.
  - Presents the boot menu and loads the kernel and initrd.

#### GRUB Version 2
- **Stage 1 (boot.img):**  
  - Installed in the MBR (or sometimes a Volume Boot Record).
  - Configured to load `core.img`.
- **Stage 1.5 (core.img):**  
  - Typically located in the sectors between the MBR and the first partition.
  - Includes modules like filesystem drivers and is generated from `diskboot.img`.
- **Stage 2:**  
  - Contains the bulk of GRUB‚Äôs functionality.
  - Loads configuration from `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`, displays boot menus, and uses commands (e.g., `linux` and `initrd`) to load the Linux kernel and the initial RAM disk.

- **Boot Menu and Chainloading:**  
  GRUB reads its configuration file, allowing the user to select an operating system or kernel version. It can also chainload other bootloaders (e.g., for Windows).

## 4. Kernel Initialization

Let's break it down step by step in simple terms! üòä  

---

### **üîπ What Happens During Kernel Initialization?**  
Once GRUB loads the **Linux kernel**, the kernel takes over and starts setting up the system.  

Think of the kernel as the **brain of the operating system**‚Äîit controls everything. But first, it needs to get itself fully ready before running programs.  

---

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Kernel Loading (Bringing the Kernel into Memory)**
- GRUB loads the **kernel file (e.g., vmlinuz)** into memory.  
- Along with it, GRUB also loads an **initrd (initial RAM disk)**, which is like a **temporary mini-filesystem** that helps the kernel get started.  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Role of initrd (Temporary Root Filesystem)**
The **initrd (or initramfs)** is a small, temporary filesystem stored in RAM.  
It‚Äôs like a **starter pack** that contains essential files and drivers that the kernel needs before it can access the real hard drive.  

üîπ **Why is this needed?**  
- The kernel **doesn‚Äôt yet know how to access your hard disk** (or other storage).  
- It needs special **drivers** (for things like RAID, LVM, USB, network storage, etc.).  
- The **initrd provides these drivers** so the kernel can properly mount the real root filesystem.  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ The "Chicken & Egg" Problem (Why initrd is Important)**
Imagine this situation:  
üêî The kernel **needs drivers** to read the disk.  
ü•ö But those drivers **are stored on the disk** itself!  

So how can the kernel load those drivers **if it can‚Äôt access the disk yet?** ü§î  

üëâ **Solution:** The `initrd` (temporary filesystem) contains these drivers, so the kernel can load them first, and then mount the real hard drive.  

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Mounting the Root Filesystem (Accessing the Real Disk)**
- After the kernel loads the necessary drivers from **initrd**, it can finally access the actual **root filesystem** (where Linux is installed).  
- At first, the root filesystem is mounted **read-only** (to prevent data corruption).  
- Later, it is **remounted as read-write**, so changes can be made (like writing logs, saving files, etc.).  

---

### **üõ† Final Step: Handing Control to init System**
- Once the root filesystem is fully mounted, the kernel starts the **init system** (like `systemd` or `sysvinit`).  
- This is what launches all the background services and finally **starts your login screen or desktop environment**! üéâ  

---

### **üîπ Summary (Step-by-Step)**
1Ô∏è‚É£ GRUB loads the **kernel** (`vmlinuz`) and **initrd** (temporary filesystem).  
2Ô∏è‚É£ The **initrd provides drivers** so the kernel can access the real hard drive.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ The kernel **mounts the real root filesystem** (first read-only, then read-write).  
4Ô∏è‚É£ The kernel **hands control to the init system** (`systemd`), which starts services and the user interface.  

---

### **üí° Simple Analogy: Moving into a New House**  
- The **kernel is like a person moving into a new house** (your computer).  
- But before you can live there, you need **basic tools** (a bed, electricity, water, etc.).  
- The **initrd is like a survival kit** that has those basic things until your actual furniture (root filesystem) arrives.  
- Once the **house (root filesystem) is set up**, you can start living normally (running programs and services).  

---

Does this explanation make sense? Let me know if you need any part clarified! üòä


- **Kernel Loading:**  
  Once GRUB has been configured, it loads the Linux kernel image (e.g., `vmlinuz`) into memory along with an initial RAM disk (initrd or initramfs).

- **Role of initrd:**  
  - **Temporary Root Filesystem:**  
    Contains necessary drivers and modules required to mount the actual root filesystem.  
  - **The Chicken/Egg Problem:**  
    The kernel needs drivers (for LVM, RAID, NFS, etc.) that aren‚Äôt built into it. The initrd provides these so the kernel can mount the real root filesystem.

- **Mounting the Root Filesystem:**  
  After loading modules from initrd, the kernel mounts the root filesystem (usually first in read-only mode) and later remounts it as read-write.

---

## 5. The init Process

- **What It Is:**  
  After kernel initialization, the very first user-space process is started. This process, called **init**, always has PID 1.

### **üîπ The `init` Process - The First Process in Linux**  
Once the kernel has finished loading and mounting the root filesystem, it needs a program to **take over and manage the system**. This first program is called **`init`**, and it has a special **Process ID (PID) of 1**.  

Think of `init` as the **boss of all processes**‚Äîit starts, stops, and manages everything happening on your system.  

---

## **1Ô∏è‚É£ What is the `init` Process?**  
- `init` is **the first process started by the Linux kernel** after booting.  
- It is **always running** until you shut down your system.  
- Every other process (like user applications, system services, and background tasks) is a **child** of `init`.  
- Its configuration is stored in `/etc/inittab` (for traditional `sysvinit` systems).  

---

## **2Ô∏è‚É£ Role of `init` in System Boot**  
Once `init` starts, it does the following:  
‚úÖ Reads its configuration file (`/etc/inittab`).  
‚úÖ Determines **which services to start** based on the system's **runlevel**.  
‚úÖ Launches background services (networking, logging, GUI, etc.).  
‚úÖ Prepares the system for user interaction (login prompt or desktop environment).  

---

## **3Ô∏è‚É£ What are Runlevels? (Understanding System States)**  
Runlevels define **what state the system should be in** and which services should be running.  

| **Runlevel** | **Purpose** | **Example Scenario** |
|-------------|------------|----------------|
| `0` | Halt (Shutdown) | When you turn off the computer. |
| `1` | Single-user mode | Maintenance mode (no networking, only root user). |
| `2` | Multi-user mode (No network) | Rarely used (multi-user, but no networking). |
| `3` | Multi-user mode (With network) | Servers usually run in this mode (no GUI). |
| `4` | Unused | Can be customized for special cases. |
| `5` | Multi-user mode (With GUI) | Normal desktop mode (graphical login). |
| `6` | Reboot | Restart the system. |

### **üí° Example: How Runlevels Work**
- If your system boots into **runlevel 3**, it starts in **command-line mode** (good for servers).  
- If it boots into **runlevel 5**, it loads a **graphical user interface (GUI)** like GNOME or KDE.  
- If you type `init 0`, it shuts down.  
- If you type `init 6`, it reboots.  

---

## **4Ô∏è‚É£ The `/etc/inittab` File (Used in sysvinit)**
The `/etc/inittab` file controls which runlevel the system should enter by default.  

Example contents of `/etc/inittab`:  
```
id:5:initdefault:
```
üîπ This means the system will **boot into runlevel 5** (GUI mode).  

Each line in `inittab` defines actions like:  
- Running background services  
- Starting login prompts  
- Handling system power events  

---

## **5Ô∏è‚É£ Modern `init` Systems (`systemd` Replacing sysvinit)**
Most modern Linux distributions (like Ubuntu, Fedora, and Arch Linux) **no longer use traditional `init`**. Instead, they use **`systemd`**, which works differently:  
- Instead of runlevels, it uses **targets** (like `graphical.target` instead of runlevel 5).  
- Faster boot times and better parallel processing.  
- Uses **`systemctl`** instead of `init` commands (e.g., `systemctl reboot` instead of `init 6`).  

---

## **üí° Simple Analogy: `init` as a School Principal**
Imagine a **school principal (`init`)** who:  
- **Opens the school (boots up the system).**  
- **Assigns teachers (services) to classrooms (runlevels).**  
- **Decides if it's a normal school day (runlevel 5) or an emergency drill (runlevel 1).**  
- **Ensures that everything runs smoothly until the school closes (shutdown).**  

---

## **üîπ Summary**
‚úÖ The **`init` process** is the first process (PID 1) that runs after the Linux kernel boots.  
‚úÖ It **manages system services and determines the runlevel (system state)**.  
‚úÖ Different **runlevels define what services are running** (GUI, CLI, single-user mode, etc.).  
‚úÖ **Older systems use `/etc/inittab`, while modern systems use `systemd` instead of `init`**.  

---



- **Responsibilities:**  
  - **System Initialization:**  
    Reads configuration files (traditionally `/etc/inittab` for SysV init systems) to determine the default runlevel and start necessary services.
  - **Parent of All Processes:**  
    All other processes on the system are spawned from `init`.

---

## 6. Runlevels

- **Definition:**  
  Runlevels are predefined states that determine which services and processes are started. They allow the system to operate in various modes.

- **Common Runlevels:**
  - **0:** Halt/Shutdown
  - **1:** Single-user (maintenance) mode  
    *Minimal services; only root can log in.*
  - **2:** Multi-user mode without networking (configuration may vary by distro)
  - **3:** Full multi-user mode with networking (typical for servers)
  - **4:** Undefined (customizable)
  - **5:** Multi-user mode with networking and graphical interface (common on desktops)
  - **6:** Reboot

- **Configuration:**  
  The default runlevel is set in `/etc/inittab` (for SysV init systems). Each runlevel is associated with a set of startup scripts (found in directories like `/etc/rc.d/rc3.d` for runlevel 3).

---

## 7. Initialization Scripts (rc.sysinit and Runlevel Scripts)

### a. **rc.sysinit**
- **Purpose:**  
  This script runs first (as specified in `/etc/inittab`) and performs fundamental system setup tasks, such as:
  - Setting the hostname
  - Checking and mounting essential filesystems (e.g., `/proc`, `/sys`)
  - Enabling swap space
  - Loading kernel modules and setting kernel parameters (using `sysctl.conf`)
  - Initializing hardware interfaces (serial ports, RAID, LVM)
  - Remounting the root filesystem in read-write mode

### b. **Runlevel Scripts**
- **Location:**  
  Each runlevel has its own directory (e.g., `/etc/rc.d/rc3.d` for runlevel 3).
- **Naming Convention:**  
  - **S (Start):** Scripts that start services.
  - **K (Kill):** Scripts that stop services.
- **Execution Order:**  
  These scripts are executed in sequence, starting or stopping services based on the current runlevel.
- **Custom Startup Commands:**  
  Finally, the `/etc/rc.local` script is run. This file allows administrators to add custom commands to be executed at the very end of the boot process.

---

## 8. Reaching the Login Prompt

- **Completion of Startup:**  
  Once all the initialization scripts have executed successfully, the system is fully booted.
- **User Interface:**  
  A login prompt is presented (either on a virtual console or a graphical display) where users can log in and start using the system.

---

## 9. GRUB Version 2 ‚Äì A Quick Breakdown

1. **Hardware Power-Up:**  
   The CPU starts in real mode and jumps to a fixed address where BIOS code resides.
2. **BIOS Execution:**  
   BIOS selects the boot device (e.g., hard disk) based on the configured boot order.
3. **MBR Loading:**  
   BIOS loads the MBR (containing boot.img) into memory.
4. **Jump to core.img:**  
   The MBR code jumps to core.img, which is stored in the free space between the MBR and the first partition.
5. **Module Initialization:**  
   `core.img` loads essential modules (like filesystem drivers) to access the /boot directory.
6. **Loading normal.mod:**  
   This module provides an interactive command-line interface.
7. **Configuration File Execution:**  
   GRUB reads `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`, builds the boot menu, and processes boot commands.
8. **Kernel Loading:**  
   GRUB executes commands like `linux /vmlinuz-linux root=/dev/sda3 ro` and `initrd /initramfs-linux.img` to load the Linux kernel and initial RAM disk.

---

This complete process‚Äîfrom the initial power-on by the BIOS, through the MBR and GRUB bootloader stages, kernel and init initialization, to the execution of startup scripts and finally arriving at the login prompt‚Äîensures that the Linux operating system starts in a controlled, step-by-step manner, setting up all required hardware, drivers, and services for proper operation.
